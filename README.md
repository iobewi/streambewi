# USB radio POC

Standalone ESP32-S3 proof of concept for the Metronic 477144 children's player.

The POC deliberately does **not** use IOBEWI. Its purpose is to discover the real
hardware/USB behaviour first, then later provide a stable reference implementation for
a separate IOBEWI porting exercise.

Target stream:

```text
http://icecast.radiofrance.fr/monpetitfranceinter-midfi.mp3
```

## Goal

Make the Metronic see an ESP32-S3 as a USB mass-storage device containing a readable
`RADIO.MP3`, then progressively replace the static/diagnostic payload with the live MP3
stream.

## Architecture

```text
targets/esp32   ESP32-S3 entry point: peripherals + IOBEWI ESP drivers (the only chip-specific code)
      |  Platform ports
      v
app/            `streambewi`: portable product logic (provisioning, stream, USB radio); no HAL
      |
      +--> core/   `usb-radio-core`: pure policy (1 GiB RADIO.MP3 geometry, prebuffer, far-ahead)
      +--> IOBEWI portable crates: iobewi-fat16, iobewi-rolling-stream, iobewi-usb-msc,
           iobewi-wifi-core/manager, iobewi-config-space
```

`streambewi::run` receives its platform as ports: a `WifiTransport`, a `ConfigBackend`, up to two
`embedded-io-async` serial ports for Improv, an `embedded-hal-async` button, a reset function and
a factory for the `embassy-usb` driver (called late: the USB pins can be shared with the serial
port used for provisioning). `targets/esp32` builds them from the IOBEWI ESP drivers
(`iobewi-esp-wifi`, `iobewi-esp-config-space`, `iobewi-esp-console`, `iobewi-esp-reset`). Another
chip needs a new `targets/<chip>` only. Logs use the `log` facade, installed by the target through
`iobewi-log`. IOBEWI crates are pinned by git rev.

## Stages

### P0 — virtual FAT16 model

The pure `usb-radio-core` crate implements a deterministic read-only FAT16 disk:

- 512-byte sectors;
- 4 MiB virtual medium;
- one root file: `RADIO.MP3`;
- 2 MiB file extent;
- data supplied by a `FileSource` trait;
- host unit tests validate the BPB, FAT chain and root entry.

This layer has no ESP or USB dependency.

### P1 — ESP32-S3 USB MSC

The `usb-radio-firmware` crate exposes the virtual disk through the ESP32-S3 native
USB OTG peripheral using `esp-hal` + `embassy-usb`.

The MSC implementation is intentionally small and read-only. It supports the SCSI
commands needed by a normal removable-disk host and logs every READ(10) request:

```text
msc: READ10 lba=<...> blocks=<...>
```

This trace is the main deliverable of the first Metronic test. It tells us whether the
player reads sequentially, reads ahead, seeks, or rereads old sectors.

At this stage the contents of `RADIO.MP3` are diagnostic bytes, not playable audio.
The acceptance criterion is enumeration + FAT mount + file discovery.

### P2 — live HTTP MP3 source — PASS

P1 proved on real hardware that the Metronic enumerates the device, finds `RADIO.MP3`,
shows `MP3` / `F001` and starts its playback counter. P2 then proved the complete live
path on the real Metronic: Radio France audio is audible without perceptible lag.

The ESP32-S3:

- joins Wi-Fi and gets an IPv4 configuration through DHCP;
- opens the Radio France HTTP MP3 stream;
- prebuffers 64 KiB before enabling USB MSC;
- keeps a 96 KiB rolling window;
- limits the network producer to at most 80 KiB ahead of the highest file offset consumed
  by USB;
- maps the live bytes to the existing `RADIO.MP3` sectors;
- waits when the Metronic asks for a sector that has not arrived yet.

The P1 FAT16 geometry is intentionally unchanged for the first streaming test. The
virtual file remains 2 MiB; this is enough to validate audible streaming before changing
file-system geometry or long-run behaviour.

Acceptance:

- Wi-Fi connects;
- the HTTP stream returns status 200;
- the 64 KiB prebuffer fills;
- USB enumeration starts only after prebuffer;
- Metronic shows `MP3` / `F001`;
- the Radio France stream is audible.

### P3 — continuous stream and USB-session rebasing

P3 removes the measured ~131 s P2 limit without turning the ESP into a huge storage
device.

The HTTP stream now uses a monotonic absolute byte position and runs continuously. Each
USB MSC connection creates a new session:

```text
infinite HTTP stream
        |
        | rolling 96 KiB RAM window
        v
current live position
        |
        +-- retain about 64 KiB before "now"
        |
        v
USB session base = RADIO.MP3 offset 0
```

If the Metronic disconnects and re-enumerates, offset 0 is therefore mapped to a fresh
position near the current live stream instead of the expired bytes from the first boot.

The virtual FAT16 geometry is also expanded:

- sector: 512 bytes;
- cluster: 32 KiB (64 sectors);
- `RADIO.MP3`: 1 GiB virtual size;
- about 18 h 38 min at 128 kbit/s before the host reaches the logical EOF;
- FAT entries are still generated on demand; the 1 GiB file is not stored in RAM/flash.

The network producer remains bounded to 80 KiB ahead of the USB consumer while a session
is active. With no USB session, the live stream keeps moving and the ring retains only
the latest window.

MSC logging is aggregated (one progress line per 256 READ(10) commands) instead of one
blocking UART line per read. Embassy USB internal trace is disabled by default and can be
restored with the `usb-debug` Cargo feature.

P3 hardware acceptance:

- provisioned Wi-Fi reconnects normally;
- Radio France becomes audible as in P2;
- playback continues beyond the former ~2 min 10 s boundary;
- no `stream: ... full` condition exists;
- after USB unplug/replug or host re-enumeration, a new `stream: session start ...`
  appears and playback starts from the current stream window rather than expired offset 0;
- no repeated `stream data expired` appears in normal forward playback.

## Build

From the repository root:

```sh
# (already at the repository root)
cargo test -p usb-radio-core -p streambewi

cargo +esp build -p usb-radio-firmware --release \
  -Z build-std=core,alloc \
  --target xtensa-esp32s3-none-elf
```

The firmware contains **no Wi-Fi credentials**: they are entered at runtime (see
[Wi-Fi provisioning](#wi-fi-provisioning-improv-serial)), so `dist/` can be versioned.

Flash/monitor, assuming `espflash` is installed:

```sh
cargo +esp run -p usb-radio-firmware --release \
  -Z build-std=core,alloc \
  --target xtensa-esp32s3-none-elf
```

## Wi-Fi provisioning (Improv Serial)

Wi-Fi is configured over the USB-UART bridge (UART0) or the native USB-Serial-JTAG port, whichever the board exposes (both are served; replies go back on the requesting port), with [Improv Serial](https://www.improv-wifi.com/serial/),
the protocol ESP Web Tools speaks after flashing.

- `improv-serial` and IOBEWI's `iobewi-wifi-manager` / `iobewi-wifi-core` /
  `iobewi-config-space` drive provisioning in `app/src/provisioning.rs`; the radio, flash and
  storage are the IOBEWI ESP drivers plugged in by `targets/esp32`.
- Credentials are validated first (association + DHCP) and only then committed to the `nvs`
  partition of the default espflash partition table (`0x9000`, 24 KiB) through ConfigSpace.
  A previous image's raw A/B records at that address are not valid NVS: flash with the erase
  option once.
- Reflashing the merged image rewrites that region: provision again after each flash.
- Flash writes stall interrupts for a few ms: provision with the OTG port **unplugged**.

Flow: flash with ESP Web Tools, choose **Connect to Wi-Fi** in its dialog (it lists the
networks seen by the board), enter the password. Boot log on success:

```text
wifi: no saved credentials; waiting for Improv provisioning
improv: provisioning ssid=...
wifi: associated ...
wifi: got IP ...
improv: provisioned, credentials saved
```

On later boots the saved network is connected automatically (`wifi: ready`), with
reconnection/backoff handled by `WifiManager`.

## Flash the POC

Board: ESP32-S3. Two different USB connectors are involved:

| Port | Pins | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| native USB OTG | D+ GPIO20, D- GPIO19 | the POC's USB mass-storage device: plug into the Metronic |
| USB-UART (CP210x/CH340 bridge, "UART" label) | UART0 | flashing and serial console: plug into the PC |

The firmware owns GPIO19/20 as USB OTG, so the native port does **not** show a serial
console; logs (`esp-println`, `uart` feature) come out on the USB-UART port only.

`dist/` holds the current (P2, Improv-provisioned) image; it contains no credentials. The
older P1-only image remains in Git history (commit `5277330`).

The flashable image is a single merged image (bootloader + partition table + app) written
at `0x0`; the matching ELF is emitted beside it.

### Browser (ESP Web Tools)

Serve `dist/` (it has its own `index.html` + `manifest.json`). If your local
web flasher expects the image under `web/firmware/esp32s3-usb-radio/`, copy the BIN there;
that directory is ignored by Git.

### Command line

```sh
scripts/flash.sh
scripts/flash.sh --port /dev/ttyUSB0
```

The port is auto-detected by `espflash` unless `--port` is given. Monitor only:
`espflash monitor --chip esp32s3`.

### Rebuild the artefacts

```sh
scripts/build-release.sh
```

Runs the core tests, the release build (real link), and `espflash save-image --merge`.
Regenerates `dist/`.

`SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` is the date of the last commit touching the POC sources, excluding
both delivery directories. This also avoids the old false "uncommitted changes" report
caused solely by regenerating `dist/`.

### Expected boot log

```text
usb-radio POC: P3 continuous HTTP MP3 -> USB MSC
usb-radio POC: DP=GPIO20 DM=GPIO19
stream: http://icecast.radiofrance.fr/monpetitfranceinter-midfi.mp3
```

When a host enumerates the device:

```text
msc: connected
msc: READ10 lba=... blocks=...
```

Only with `--features usb-debug` (not in the delivered image): bus lifecycle
(`usb: enabled=true`, `usb: bus reset`, `usb: addressed=N`, `usb: configured=true`,
`usb: suspended=...`), `msc: cmd op=0x.. xfer=.. tag=..` (first 24 non-READ10 commands per
session), `msc: get max lun`, and embassy-usb control-request tracing. No `bus reset` = the
host never drove the bus; reset/addressed without `configured=true` = enumeration stops
before SET_CONFIGURATION.

Other lines: `msc: bulk-only reset`, `msc: unsupported SCSI opcode=0x.. xfer=..`
(answered with CSW status 1 + sense ILLEGAL REQUEST), `msc: disconnected`.

## Gate P1-METRONIC (hardware, manual)

Precondition: POC flashed on the ESP32-S3.

1. Start the serial monitor on the USB-UART port.
2. Plug the **native OTG** port into the Metronic 477144.
3. Wait for detection; check whether the player shows a drive / a file.
4. Save the full serial log.

Record: USB enumeration OK or not; `msc: connected` present or not; unsupported SCSI
opcodes; the READ10 sequence (first LBA, transfer sizes, re-reads, backward/forward
jumps); behaviour on unplug (`msc: disconnected`).

Not PASS without real hardware.

## Wiring

ESP32-S3 native USB FS:

- D+ = GPIO20
- D- = GPIO19

Use the board's native USB/OTG connector or a connector wired to those pins. Do not use a
USB-UART bridge port and assume it is the native OTG peripheral.

## Important limitation

P3 provides a long-lived view, not a mathematically infinite FAT file. One USB session
exposes 1 GiB (about 18 h 38 min at the measured ~128 kbit/s). A new USB session rebases
the file to the current live window. The rolling RAM window remains 96 KiB, so very large
backward seeks are intentionally unsupported; the measured Metronic access pattern is
forward-only.
